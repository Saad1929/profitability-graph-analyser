# Profitability Graph Analyser - Python
## Brief Summary
- Personal Project which employs **Python** to generate **visually intuitive graphs** from stock sales data **retrieved from a database** through **Comma-Separated Values (CSV) file handling**.
- The project is now **fully operational** and being **utilised at a local convenience store**.
- The project was **planned collaboratively** with the **involvement of two other developers**, emphasising **teamwork** in software design and development.
## üéØAims and Motivation
- The **primary objective** of this project was to enable users to **effortlessly visualise** their sales data from the database through **graphical representation**, aiding in better **comprehension and analysis**.
- **Motivated** by an **unrelenting passion for knowledge and personal growth**, I took on the **responsibility** of utilising **back-end technologies** to assist others as well as **expanding my expertise in back-end technologies**.
## ‚öôÔ∏èTechnologies, Requirements and Software Tools
### Programming & Scriping Languages
- Python3
- MySQL
### Pip & Python Package Requirements
- Matplotlib
### Other Software Tools
- **Comma-Separated Values (CSV)** files were utilised in conjunction with **file handling operations** as part of the project's implementation.
- **Git** was used as a **Version Control System (VCS)** to **maintain a history of the software project**.
- **GitHub** was used to **host and maintain history of the project**.
## ‚úèÔ∏èDesign
### Back-End Technology Stack
- As a **back-end project**, **Python3** was employed to develop **profitability graphs** using the **matplotlib package** which enables users to **conveniently monitor and track the performance of products**, identifying both **successful and underperforming items**.
- Upon converting database information into a **CSV file**, a **sophisticated data structure** was created which is used to **store the information retrieved from the database** using **CSV File Handling**.
